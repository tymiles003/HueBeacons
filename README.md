# HueBeacons

Estimote iBeacons controlling Hue lightbulbs (based on the Philips Hue iOS SDK Quick Start sample).

[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6K9zkH9hw0)

## Usage

1. Setup your beacons in `InitRegion` of PHControlLightsViewController.m:

    ```
    ...
    // Setup your iBeacons here
    self.beaconRegion1 = [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUID:proximityUUID major:19313 minor:25175 identifier:@"Blueberry Pie"];
    self.beaconRegion2 = [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUID:proximityUUID major:36081 minor:35603 identifier:@"Icy Marshmallow"];
    self.beaconRegion3 = [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUID:proximityUUID major:29580 minor:8741 identifier:@"Mint Cocktail"];
    
    NSArray *hueBeaconKeys = @[@"major",@"minor",@"beaconName",@"lightIdentifier"];
    
    // Setup the mapping of your Hue bulbs (light ID) here. This may take some  trial and error.
    NSMutableDictionary *hueBeacon1 = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:@[self.beaconRegion1.major,self.beaconRegion1.minor,self.beaconRegion1.identifier,@"1"] forKeys:hueBeaconKeys];
    NSMutableDictionary *hueBeacon2 = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:@[self.beaconRegion2.major,self.beaconRegion2.minor,self.beaconRegion2.identifier,@"2"] forKeys:hueBeaconKeys];
    NSMutableDictionary *hueBeacon3 = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:@[self.beaconRegion3.major,self.beaconRegion3.minor,self.beaconRegion3.identifier,@"3"] forKeys:hueBeaconKeys];
    ...
    ```

2. Most of the magic happens in `(void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didRangeBeacons:(NSArray *)beacons inRegion:(CLBeaconRegion *)region`:

    ```
    for (CLBeacon* beacon in beacons){
    ...
	    for (PHLight *light in cache.lights.allValues) {
		    if ([light.identifier isEqualToString:lightIdentifierForBeacon]){
			    // If within 1M of the current beacon
			    if(beacon.accuracy<=1.0){
				    ...
				    [lightState setOnBool:YES];
			    } else {
				    [lightState setOnBool:NO];
			    }
			
			    [bridgeSendAPI updateLightStateForId:lightIdentifierForBeacon withLighState:lightState completionHandler:^(NSArray *errors) {
				    if (errors != nil) {
					    ...
				    }
			    }];
		    }
	    }
	    [self.hueBeaconMapping setObject:hueBeacon forKey:hueBeaconKey];
    }
    ```

Just take me where the light is.
